Key Concept 
Key concepts and technological advancements for enhancing the security of business networks, devices, and systems will be covered in this section. 
Infrastructure Considerations
Device placement: arranging servers, network appliances, and end-user devices in a way that maximizes security and reduces attack surface. 
Security Zones: To improve network segmentation and threat containment, the infrastructure should be divided into discrete security zones with restricted access. 
Attack Surface: Identifying and minimizing the exposed points where an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to infrastructure. 
Connectivity Failure Modes: Building the infrastructure to securely manage connectivity failures, such as when it fails to open or close.
Device Placement
Place important devices, including servers and network appliances, insecure physical locations with controlled access.  
To avoid unwanted access, place network access points—such as switches and wireless access points—in locations that are simple to monitor.
To restrict the impact of a branch and reduce the attack surface, distribute devices across multiple security zones.
Security Zones
Perimeter Zone: is the outermost layer of protection, meant to safeguard the company from external threats. Includes firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS/IDS), and other network appliances. 
Internal Zone: The internal network where daily company operations occur. This zone frequently features tougher access controls and micro-segmentation to restrict movement.
DMZ Zone: A neutralized area between internal and external networks that hosts publicly accessible servers and services. 
Attack Surfaces
The attack surface of a business infrastructure includes all potential access points and vulnerabilities that malicious parties could exploit. Minimizing the attack surface is crucial to improving security. This includes safeguarding external-facing systems, monitoring network traffic, and installing strong access controls to prevent unwanted access to key resources.
